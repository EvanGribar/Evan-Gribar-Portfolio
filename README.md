## Overview

This portfolio serves as a digital canvas to showcase my work in Business Analytics and Digital Strategy. It moves beyond traditional web design, utilizing high-end shader simulations and fluid interactivity to create a memorable user experience.

## Technical Architecture

Built with a focus on performance and visual fidelity:

*   **Core**: React 18, Vite
*   **3D / WebGL**: Three.js, React Three Fiber (R3F)
*   **Shaders & Effects**: Custom curl-noise particle simulations, Depth of Field, Bloom
*   **Animations**: Framer Motion (Spring physics for cursor and UI)
*   **Styling**: TailwindCSS (Utility-first)
*   **Typography**: Inter (Google Fonts)

## Key Features

*   **Cinematic Flow Field**: A global, background particle system (2000+ nodes) that mimics organic fluid flow.
*   **Magnetic Interaction**: Particles react subtly to mouse movement, creating liquid ripples.
*   **Text Repulsion**: The flow field intelligently avoids the central hero text, ensuring maximum readability.
*   **Glassmorphism**: UI components utilize `backdrop-blur` to seamlessly blend with the living background.
*   **Alabama Palette**: A custom shader color mix of Crimson (#9E1B32), Bright Red, and White.
